# HAB-illness

Welcome! This is the place to update the Illness maps for the CCHAB portal. 

Steps
1. Get new information from Rebecca (Beckye) Stanton; rebecca.stanton@oehha.ca.gov
2. Convert her information into an excel spreadsheet for each map you'd like to create. For example:
  A. 2021
  B. 2018-2020
  C. 2018-2021
3. You can see the excel spreadsheets from similar years. I recomend just updating them but keep and save with the same wording. Once complete save as a .txt file
4. Open the Simple_R_Code, R script. Update as needed, for example:
  A. install packages if needed
  B. load packages
  C. setup your work directory
  D. update the years to the ones of interest. Note: in R Studio, there is a find and replace option
